This is a Weather Prediction System.
It displays various weather conditions of a location based on the dataset provided.
The system takes a dataset as an input(.csv format) and then the system is trained based on the values of the dataset.
These Dataset values are first used to train the model, then the system is tested with the test case values.
I tried to compare the predicted values and the actual values and tried to minimise the error.
The System provides accurate and reliable information about weather conditions.
